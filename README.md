# Mission-to-Mars

## Deliverable 1

Inspected the page and retrived all hemisphere items , created a for loop to:

1) find each hemisphere's title
2) visit each hemisphere's page by getting the link
3) looking for the full size image on each hemisphere page
4) storing the title and full size path in a dictionary
5) returning to the main page 

Repeated this for each hemisphere.
Added title and full-size image path dictionary item to the list

## Deliverable 2

- In Scraping.py file created a function to do all I did in deliverable 1 within a function

- Edited the scrape_all function to include data from this recent function.

- Ran app.py then checked the mongoDB to make sure the new info is added to the db.

- Updated the index.html page to correspond to my variables names.

- Opened the web (local) address and scraped new data and made sure it is being displayed correctly.


## Deliverable 3

- Tested the page to make sure it is mobile friendly, meaning it is responsive to a different screen size.

- Added two bootstrap 3 components to the page:

  1) Updated the grid system to fit 4 hemispheres in one row by using  class="col-md-3"
  2) Updated the Mars Facts table to highlight the rows that are hovered.
